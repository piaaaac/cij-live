Description:

Tyler Schultz is the whistleblower who first raised the alarm on Elizabeth Holmes's $10billion company Theranos. In conversation with Delphine Halgand-Mishra, Executive Director of The Signals Network, he discusses the experience of turning whistleblower against fashionable big business and venture capital, the legal archipelago which often confronts those who speak out, the experience of dealing with journalists, and the wider implications of the case.
